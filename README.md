### How to access admin features
The administration features are meant to be hidden from the average users. The idea here is that the employees or the owner would know or have written down the links to access the different admin features and it is not linked anywhere on the site for the average user to find. However, there is a password page to futher prevent others from accessing these pages. There are two simple steps to access the admin pages:
1. Add /admin onto the url of the reservation, cats, or menu pages.
2. Enter the password: I want to pet a cat.
